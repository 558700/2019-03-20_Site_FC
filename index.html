		<p>What the internet and it's adjacent technology means to us, and the way it tempers the way we see and appreciate the world, is still in flux. Sometimes this is inspiring, and exciting; sometimes it's terrifying and confusing</p>

		<p>I believe that creativity and good design can simplify problems, and provide some solutions. But these are only interfaces between the forces of our time that shape the internet: prevailing power, and the infrastructure of the internet.</p>

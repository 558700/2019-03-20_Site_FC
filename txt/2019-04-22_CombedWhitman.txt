One’s-self I sing, a simple separate person
Of physiology from top to toe I sing
Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power
As I ponder’d in silence
Be it so, then I answer’d
In cabin’d ships at sea
Here are our thoughts, voyagers’ thoughts
Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny
I heard that you ask’d for something to prove this puzzle the New World
You who celebrate bygones
A war O soldiers not for itself alone
I met a seer
Put in thy chants said he
Ever the dim beginning
Ever the mutable
Lo, I or you
The ostent evanescent
Of every human life
The old, old urge
The present now and here
These with the past
Densities, growth, facades
Exalte, rapt, ecstatic
All space, all time
The noiseless myriads
Not this the world
Beyond thy lectures learn’d professor
Unfix’d yet fix’d
The prophet and the bard
And thee my soul
Thy body permanent
Thy very songs not in thy songs
For him I sing
When I read the book, the biography famous
Beginning my studies the first step pleas’d me so much
How they are provided for upon the earth, appearing at intervals
To the States or any one of them, or any city of the States
On journeys through the States we start
We have watch’d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on
We dwell a while in every city and town
Here, take this gift
Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature
Lo, the unbounded sea
I hear the world singing, the varied carols I hear
What place is besieged
Still though the one I sing
Shut not your doors to me proud libraries
Poets to come! orators, singers
I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future
I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping
Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me
Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I
See revolving the globe
See, vast trackless spaces
See, projected through time
With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop
Chants of the prairies
I conn’d old times
Here lands female and male
I will acknowledge contemporary lands
I will sing the song of companionship
Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may
I too, following many and follow’d by many, inaugurate a religion
Each is not for its own sake
I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough
It is well — against such I say not a word, I am their poet also
Listen dear son — listen the world, daughter or son
Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen
Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me
I have seen the he-bird also
Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us
I will make the songs of passion to give them their way
I will make the true poem of riches
I will not make poems with reference to parts
Of your real body and any man’s or woman’s real body
Not the types set up by the printer return their impression
Behold, the body includes and is the meaning
Interlink’d
No dainty dolce affettuoso I
The red aborigines
These, my voice announcing — I will sleep no more but arise
I loafe and invite my soul
My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air
Creeds and schools in abeyance
The atmosphere is not a perfume
The smoke of my own breath
There was never any more inception than there is now
Urge and urge and urge
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance
Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights
Clear and sweet is my soul
Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean
I am satisfied — I see, dance, laugh
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am
Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord
Or I guess the grass is itself a child
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic
Tenderly will I use you curling grass
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women
They are alive and well somewhere
All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses
I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth
Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female
Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded
The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom
The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles
I am there, I help, I came stretch’d atop of the load
The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud
The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west
The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank
Where are you off to, lady? for I see you
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather
The beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair
An unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies
The young men float on their backs
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil
From the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements
I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there
In me the caresser of life wherever moving
Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade
I believe in those wing’d purposes
The sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections
I am enamour’d of growing out-doors
What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me
I resist any thing better than my own diversity
The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is
I beat and pound for the dead
This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair
This hour I tell things in confidence
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own
I do not snivel that snivel the world over
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids
Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair
In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less
I know I am solid and sound
I know I am deathless
I know I am august
I exist as I am, that is enough
One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself
My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite
I am the poet of the woman the same as the man
I chant the chant of dilation or pride
I am he that walks with the tender and growing night
Prodigal
Sea of stretch’d ground-swells
Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation
I am he attesting sympathy
I am not the poet of goodness only
I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such wonder
A word of the faith that never balks
It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all
I accept Reality and dare not question it
Gentlemen
Less the reminders of properties told my words
Whoever degrades another degrades me
Through me the afflatus surging and surging
I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy
Through me many long dumb voices
Through me forbidden voices
I do not press my fingers across my mouth
I believe in the flesh and the appetites
Divine am I inside and out
I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious
That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs
The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach
Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself
Come now I will not be tantalized
My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am
Writing and talk do not prove me
I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames
I hear the violoncello, ’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint
I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me
Mine is no callous shell
I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy
The sentries desert every other part of me
I am given up by traitors
You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat
Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan
Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital
Logic and sermons never convince
Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so
A minute and a drop of me settle my brain
I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits
In vain the speeding or shyness
They do not sweat and whine about their condition
So they show their relations to me and I accept them
I wonder where they get those tokens
Myself moving forward then and now and forever
A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses
His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him
I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion
My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps
By the city’s quadrangular houses — in log huts, camping with lumber-men
I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul
I help myself to material and immaterial
I anchor my ship for a little while only
I go hunting polar furs and the seal
I ascend to the foretruck
I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires
My voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs
I understand the large hearts of heroes
The disdain and calmness of martyrs
I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs
Agonies are one of my changes of garments
I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken
I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake
Distant and dead resuscitate
I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment
Again the long roll of the drummers
I take part, I see and hear the whole
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general
They were the glory of the race of rangers
None obey’d the command to kneel
Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, said he
We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d
We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water
Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels
Our frigate takes fire
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain
Only three guns are in use
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery
Not a moment’s cease
One of the pumps has been shot away
Serene stands the little captain
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch
Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp
Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them
I remember now
I troop forth replenish’d with supreme power
Eleves
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him
Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass
Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands
Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot
Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity
You there, impotent, loose in the knees
I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me
To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean
To any one dying
I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will
I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up
Sleep — I and they keep guard all night
I heard what was said of the universe
Magnifying and applying come I
Come my children
My head slues round on my neck
Ever the hard unsunk ground
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking
This is the city and I am one of the citizens
I know perfectly well my own egotism
Not words of routine this song of mine
Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers
I do not know what is untried and afterward
Each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d
It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried
What is known I strip away
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers
Births have brought us richness and variety
I do not call one greater and one smaller
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother
I am an acme of things accomplish’d
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me
Immense have been the preparations for me
Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me
For it the nebula cohered to an orb
All forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me
My lovers suffocate me
Old age superbly rising! O welcome
Every condition promulges not only itself
I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems
Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding
My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues
See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that
My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain
I tramp a perpetual journey
Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you
It is not far, it is within reach
Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth
If you tire, give me both burdens
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven
You are also asking me questions and I hear you
Sit a while dear son
Long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams
Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power
I teach straying from me
I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house
If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore
No shutter’d room or school can commune with me
The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well
The soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine
And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God
I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night
Wrench’d and sweaty — calm and cool then my body becomes
I do not know it — it is without name — it is a word unsaid
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on
I concentrate toward them that are nigh
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable
The last scud of day holds back for me
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged
To the garden the world anew ascending
From pent-up aching rivers
The expression of the face balks account
The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women
This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person
This the nucleus — after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman
Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest
The female contains all qualities and tempers them
As I see my soul reflected in Nature
The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred
All is a procession
Gentlemen look on this wonder
In this head the all-baffling brain
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white
Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition
Within there runs blood
This is not only one man
If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred
A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking
Sex contains all, bodies, souls
Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex
Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women
They are not one jot less than I am
I draw you close to me, you women
It is I, you women, I make my way
Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself
Spontaneous me, Nature
O to be yielded to you whoever you are
O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep and dark pool
Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me
Now we have met, we have look’d, we are safe
Ages and ages returning at intervals
We two, how long we were fool’d
Native moments — when you come upon me — ah you are here now
Facing west from California’s shores
As Adam early in the morning
In paths untrodden
Scented herbage of my breast
Whoever you are holding me now in hand
The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial
Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing
But these leaves conning you con at peril
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book
Come, I will make the continent indissoluble
I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of the world
For you these from me, O Democracy
These I singing in spring collect for lovers
Not heaving from my ribb’d breast only
Of the terrible doubt of appearances
And now gentlemen
So to the students the old professor
Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems
Recorders ages hence
Roots and leaves themselves alone are these
Not heat flames up and consumes
City of orgies, walks and joys
Behold this swarthy face, these gray eyes
I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing
Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you
This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone
I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions
The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing
We two boys together clinging
A promise to California
Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting
No labor-saving machine
A glimpse through an interstice caught
Earth, my likeness
To the East and to the West
Among the men and women the multitude
Ah lover and perfect equal
O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you
That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood
Full of life now, compact, visible
When you read these I that was visible am become invisible
I hear the workman singing and the farmer’s wife singing
I see plenteous waters
I behold the mariners of the world
I behold the sail and steamships of the world
I see the electric telegraphs of the earth
I see the long river-stripes of the earth
I see the nameless masonries
I see the places of the sagas
I see the steppes of Asia
I see the highlands of Abyssinia
I see the Brazilian vaquero
I see the cities of the earth and make myself at random a part of them
I see all the menials of the earth, laboring
I see male and female everywhere
Each of us inevitable
You vapors, I think I have risen with you
What cities the light or warmth penetrates I penetrate those cities myself
Toward you all, in the world’s name
Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune
The earth, that is sufficient
Still here I carry my old delicious burdens
Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial
O highway I travel
O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you
I think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air
I inhale great draughts of space
I am larger, better than I thought
All seems beautiful to me
Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons
Here a great personal deed has room
Here is the test of wisdom
Now I re-examine philosophies and religions
Here is realization
Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d
Here rises the fluid and attaching character
The earth never tires
Allons! we must not stop here
Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements
I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes
All parts away for the progress of souls
Forever alive, forever forward
Whoever you are
Behold through you as bad as the rest
No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession
My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion
Camerado
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes
Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore
I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old
Whatever it is, it avails not — distance avails not, and place avails not
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting
You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers
A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother
Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final
Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape
He puts things in their attitudes
He is the Answerer
A man is a summons and challenge
Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride
Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place
His welcome is universal
Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue
He walks with perfect ease in the capitol
Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic
The English believe he comes of their English stock
Whoever he looks at in the traveler’s coffee-house claims him
The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood
The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets
All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems
Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health
The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer
The words of the true poems give you more than poems
They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset
O the joy of the strong-brawn’d fighter
O the of increase, growth, recuperation
O to go back to the place where I was born
O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast
Another time in warm weather out in a boat
I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the shore
Another time mackerel-taking
O boating on the rivers
O to work in mines, or forging iron
O the old manhood of me
O the joy of my soul leaning pois’d on itself
O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore
O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave
For not life’s joys alone I sing
O to struggle against great odds
Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades
Away! these are not to be cherish’d for themselves
A great city is that which has the greatest men and women
Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards
Than this nothing has better served, it has served all
I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs
I see those who in any land have died for the good cause
I see the blood wash’d entirely away from the axe
I see the headsman withdraw and become useless
I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race
After all not to create only, or found only
Long and long has the grass been growing
The dame of dames! can I believe then
Yes, if you will allow me to say so
I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigre
Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you
Mightier than Egypt’s tombs
As in a waking vision
Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet
Not only all the world of works, trade, products
Here shall you trace in flowing operation
In large calm halls
One stately house shall be the music house
The male and female many laboring not
To you ye reverent sane sisters
I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here
With latest connections, works, the inter-transportation of the world
Thou, also thou, a World
And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in earnest
Behold, the world! and thou
Behold, the sea itself
Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west
Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen
There by the furnace, and there by the anvil
Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents
Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South
Protectress absolute
Now here and these and hence in peace
While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear Mother
Farewell my brethren
Along the northern coast
The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not
Murmuring out of its myriad leaves
You untold life of me
Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers
For them predicted long
Then to a loftier strain
Not wan from Asia’s fetiches
You occult deep volitions
For man of you, your characteristic race
Thus on the northern coast
The new society at last, proportionate to Nature
Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared
The learn’d, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms
Neither a servant nor a master I
Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a thief
Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every country
The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband
Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades
I bring what you much need yet always have
There is something that comes to one now and perpetually
You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it
The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity
Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections
We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand
We consider bibles and religions divine — I do not say they are not divine
List close my scholars dear
All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it
All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments
Strange and hard that paradox true I give
House-building, measuring, sawing the boards
I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile
When the script preaches instead of the preacher
Were you thinking that those were the words
Human bodies are words, myriads of words
Air, soil, water, fire — those are words
A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words
The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth
Amelioration is one of the earth’s words
The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough
The earth does not argue
The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself
To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail
Of the interminable sisters
With her ample back towards every beholder
Seen at hand or seen at a distance
Embracing man, embracing all
Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading
Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid
Each man to himself and each woman to herself
The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him
I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words
I swear I see what is better than to tell the best
When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot
The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best
Say on, sayers! sing on
I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall
Youth, large, lusty, loving — youth full of grace, force, fascination
Day full-blown and splendid-day of the immense sun, action
In this broad earth of ours
By every life a share or more or less
Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science
In spiral routes by long detours
For it the mystic evolution
Forth from their masks, no matter what
Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow
From imperfection’s murkiest cloud
To fashion’s, custom’s discord
O the blest eyes, the happy hearts
Thou too surroundest all
The measure’d faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of the past
All, all for immortality
Give me O God to sing that thought
Come my tan-faced children
For we cannot tarry here
O you youths, Western youths
All the past we leave behind
We detachments steady throwing
We primeval forests felling
Colorado men are we
From Nebraska, from Arkansas
Raise the mighty mother mistress
See my children, resolute children
On and on the compact ranks
All the pulses of the world
Life’s involv’d and varied pageants
All the hapless silent lovers
I too with my soul and body
Lo
These are of us, they are with us
Not for delectations sweet
Till with sound of trumpet
Whoever you are, I fear you are walking the walks of dreams
Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem
O I have been dilatory and dumb
I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you
Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre-figure of all
The mockeries are not you
There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you
As for me
The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing sufficiency
I walk’d the shores of my Eastern sea
Pale, silent, stern
Hence I sign this salute over the sea
Myself and mine gymnastic ever
Not for an embroiderer
Not to chisel ornaments
Let me have my own way
Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens
I give nothing as duties
Let others dispose of questions, I dispose of nothing
I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends
After me
I must follow up these continual lessons of the air, water, earth
As for me, torn, stormy, amid these vehement days
I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews
I know that the past was great and the future will be great
Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold
When million-footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements
The Originatress comes
See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the procession
Geography, the world, is in it
For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant
The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed
Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother
They are justified, they are accomplish’d
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking
Once Paumanok
Till of a sudden
And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea
Yes, when the stars glisten’d
He call’d on his mate
Yes my brother I know
Listen’d to keep, to sing, now translating the notes
Low hangs the moon, it rose late
O madly the sea pushes upon the land
Do not be decoy’d elsewhere
O brown halo in the sky near the moon
The aria sinking
Demon or bird! said the boy’s soul
O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me
O give me the clue! it lurks in the night here somewhere
A word then, for I will conquer it
Whereto answering, the sea
Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt
O baffled, balk’d, bent to the very earth
I perceive I have not really understood any thing
You friable shore with trails of debris
I too Paumanok
I throw myself upon your breast my father
Kiss me my father
I mean tenderly by you and all
Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses
Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm
Far, far at sea
Thou born to match the gale, thou art all wings
Aboard at a ship’s helm
Through fog on a sea-coast dolefully ringing
O you give good notice indeed, you bell by the sea-reefs ringing
For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the loud admonition
But O the ship
On the beach at night
Up through the darkness
From the beach the child holding the hand of her father
Weep not, child
Something there is
The world below the brine
On the beach at night alone
A vast similitude interlocks all
Of sea-captains young or old, and the mates, and of all intrepid sailors
Ever the heroes on water or on land, by ones or twos appearing
Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running
After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds
To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early
I love to look on the Stars and Stripes
A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping
If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President’s marshal
For shame old maniacs — bring down those toss’d arms
I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England
Now call for the President’s marshal again, bring out the government cannon
The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs
Stick your hands in your pockets
Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves
And you, paid to defile the People — you liars
Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge
But the sweetness of mercy brew’d bitter destruction
Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape
Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men
Those corpses of young men
Not a grave of the murder’d for freedom but grows seed for freedom
Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose
Hold it up sternly — see this it sends back
Lover divine and perfect Comrade
Thou, thou, the Ideal Man
O Death, for Life has served its turn
Aught, aught of mightiest, best I see, conceive, or know
All great ideas, the races’ aspirations
Or Time and Space
Forms, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts
When I heard the learn’d astronomer
Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves
O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring
All you are doing and saying is to the world dangled mirages
I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world
What you give me I cheerfully accept
Skirting the river road, my forenoon walk, my rest
Roaming in thought over the Universe
Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn
Silent and amazed even when a little boy
On a flat road runs the well-train’d runner
Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some young
I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother
Of obedience, faith
A mask, a perpetual natural disguiser of herself
Of justice — as If could be any thing but the same ample law
Gliding o’er all, through all
Hast never come to thee an hour
Of Equality — as if it harm’d me
Locations and times — what is it in me that meets them all
A thousand perfect men and women appear
Why reclining
First O songs for a prelude
Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading
A shock electric, the night sustain’d it
From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways
To the drum-taps prompt
And the sturdy artillery
And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta
Arm’d year — year of the struggle
From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird
I’ll weave the chord and twine in
But I am not the sea nor the red sun
I mark’d the white combs where they career’d so high, curling over
The noble sire fallen on evil days
The noble son on sinewy feet advancing
Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking
[Volunteer of 1861-2, at Washington Park, Brooklyn
Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means
But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters
As wending the crowds now part and disperse — but we old man
Aye, this is the ground
As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration
’Twas a bold act then — the English war-ships had just arrived
A few days more and they landed
Twenty thousand were brought against us
I tell not now the whole of the battle
Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus’ waters
The General watch’d them from this hill
It sickens me yet
Meanwhile the British manœuvr’d to draw us out for a pitch’d battle
We fought the fight in detachments
That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men
That and here my General’s first battle
But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain
So dull and damp and another day
I saw him at the river-side
Every one else seem’d fill’d with gloom
But when my General pass’d me
I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward
See — as the annual round returns the phantoms return
Ah
A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands
I see before me now a traveling army halting
With its cloud of skirmishers in advance
By the bivouac’s fitful flame
Come up from the fields father, here’s a letter from our Pete
Lo, ’tis autumn
Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain
Down in the fields all prospers well
Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling
Open the envelope quickly
Ah now the single figure to me
Grieve not so, dear mother
Alas poor boy, he will never be better
But the mother needs to be better
A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown
A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim
Curious I halt and silent stand
As toilsome I wander’d Virginia’s woods
Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering
Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port
But in silence, in dreams’ projections
Bearing the bandages, water and sponge
I onward go, I stop
From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand
I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep
I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound
I am faithful, I do not give out
Long, too long the world
These demanding to have them, tired with ceaseless excitement
Lo, the moon ascending
I see a sad procession
I hear the great drums pounding
For the son is brought with the father
Now nearer blow the bugles
In the eastern sky up-buoying
The moon gives you light
Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice
Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious
No danger shall balk Columbia’s lovers
One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian’s comrade
To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come
It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection
These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron
I saw old General at bay
While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long
Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human
’Tis while our army lines Carolina’s sands and pines
Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder’d
No further does she say, but lingering all the day
What is it fateful woman, so blear
Not youth pertains to me
World take good notice, silver stars fading
O tan-faced prairie-boy
Look down fair moon and bathe this scene
Word over all, beautiful as the sky
How solemn as one by one
As I lay with my head in your lap camerado
Lo, Victress on the peaks
Adieu O soldier
Adieu dear comrade
Turn O Libertad, for the war is over
To the leaven’d soil they trod calling I sing for the last
Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring
Solitary the thrush
Song of the bleeding throat
All over bouquets of roses
Sea-winds blown from east and west
Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty
Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me
From deep secluded recesses
And the charm of the carol rapt me
Come lovely and soothing death
Prais’d be the fathomless universe
Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet
Approach strong deliveress
From me to thee glad serenades
The night in silence under many a star
Over the tree-tops I float thee a song
Loud in the pines and cedars dim
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed
And I saw askant the armies
I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them
I cease from my song for thee
Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
Hush’d be the camps to-day
No more for him life’s stormy conflicts
Sing of the love we bore him — because you, dweller in camps
As they invault the coffin there
This dust was once the man
By blue Ontario’s shore
Democracy, the destin’d conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere
A breed whose proof is in time and deeds
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves
All is eligible to all
All comes by the body
Produce great Persons
I am he who walks the States with a barb’d tongue
With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children
O lands
Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse
the world, curious toward foreign characters
Any period one nation must lead
These States are the amplest poem
To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account
For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals
Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality
Songs of stern defiance ever ready
Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body and mind
He masters whose spirit masters
Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets
Give me the pay I have served for
Say O Mother
Underneath all, individuals
Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your hand
Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women
I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself
Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments
I dare not shirk any part of myself
I am for those that have never been master’d
I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth
I will not be outfaced by irrational things
Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim’d at your breast
I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes
I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my sake
And I saw the free souls of poets
Bards for my own land only I invoke
Let that which stood in front go behind
As Consequent
As consequent from store of summer rains
Life’s ever-modern rapids first, soon, soon to blend
Some threading Ohio’s farm-fields or the woods
In you whoe’er you are my book perusing
Currents for starting a continent new
Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring
O little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless
O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice
But now I sing not war
Ask’d room those flush’d immortal ranks
Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs
Pass — then rattle drums again
Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature
Nor do I forget you Departed
I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies
No holiday soldiers — youthful, yet veterans
A pause — the armies wait
Melt, melt away ye armies — disperse ye blue-clad soldiers
All till’d and untill’d fields expand before me
I see the heroes at other toils
I see where the Mother of All
Busy the far, the sunlit panorama
Well-pleased the world thou beholdest
Beneath thy look O Maternal
All gather and all harvest
Under thee only they harvest
There was a child went forth every day
The early lilacs became part of this child
The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him
His own parents
The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table
Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty
Yet a word ancient mother
By the city dead-house by the gate
Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient
Courage yet
What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents
Not songs of loyalty alone are these
The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat
When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go
When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs
Then courage European revolter
I do not know what you are for, I do not know what I am for myself
Nations ten thousand years before these States
O I know that those men and women were not for nothing
Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand
I believe of all those men and women that fill’d the unnamed lands
Manhattan’s streets I saunter’d pondering
The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence
The soul is of itself
The indirect is just as much as the direct
Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration
No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does
Who has been wise receives interest
Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect
Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time
What is prudence is indivisible
O sight of pity
A soul confined by bars and bands
Ceaseless she paces to and fro
It was not I that sinn’d the sin
Dear prison’d soul bear up a space
Convict no more, nor shame
While upon all, convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr’d
O sight of pity
Warble me now for joy of lilac-time, returning in reminiscence
While through the interior vistas
In one, among the city streets a laborer’s home appear’d
In one, the sacred parturition scene
In one, at a bounteous morning meal
In one, by twos and threes, young people
In one a trio beautiful
In one, along a suite of noble rooms
All, all the shows of laboring life
Nor by your streams alone, you rivers
I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck
My spirit to yours dear brother
You felons on trial in courts
You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms
Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch’d and choked
Laws for creations
Be composed — be at ease with me — I am Walt Whitman
My girl I appoint with you an appointment
I was looking a long while for Intentions
Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth
Why
To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle
Where the city’s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day
By the curb toward the edge of the flagging
The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me
You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood
Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded
What am I after all but a child
Who includes diversity and is Nature
The great laws take and effuse without argument
It is no small matter
I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman
And that my soul embraces you this hour
And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful
And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth
All submit to them where they sit, inner, secure
O star of France
Dim smitten star
Star crucified — by traitors sold
Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee
In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly
O star! O ship of France
Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself
Finish’d the days
In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region
An old man’s thought of school
Now only do I know you
And these I see, these sparkling eyes
Ah more
And you the world
Wandering at morn
There ponder’d, felt I
Through the soft evening air enwinding all
While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl’d realm
With all thy gifts the world
In a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix’d house
A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude
A festival song
Now loud approaching drums
Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in agony
Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me
Now the great organ sounds
The manly strophe of the husbands of the world
The tongues of violins
All songs of current lands come sounding round me
Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion
I see poor crazed Lucia’s eyes’ unnatural gleam
I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden
To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven
Awaking from her woes at last retriev’d Amina sings
The teeming lady comes
I hear the dance-music of all nations
I see religious dances old and new
I see again the wild old Corybantian dance
I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling
I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings
Such led to thee O soul
I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul’s cathedral
Give me to hold all sounds, I madly struggling cry
And I said, moreover
Not you alone proud truths of the world
A worship new I sing
In one again, different, yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same
Along all history, down the slopes
Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating
Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and shall be carried out
After the seas are all cross’d, as they seem already cross’d
Then not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and inventors
Lo soul, the retrospect brought forward
The mediaeval navigators rise before me
As the chief histrion
Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts of heroes
O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me
With laugh and many a kiss
Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God
O soul thou pleasest me, I thee
O Thou transcendent
Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God
Greater than stars or suns
Reckoning ahead O soul, when thou, the time achiev’d
Passage to you, your shores
Passage
Sail forth — steer for the deep waters only
A batter’d, wreck’d old man
Thou knowest my years entire, my life
All my emprises have been fill’d with Thee
O I am sure they really came from Thee
By me and these the work so far accomplish’d
The end I know not, it is all in Thee
One effort more
My terminus near
My hands, my limbs grow nerveless
Is it the prophet’s thought I speak
And these things I see suddenly
How solemn they look there, stretch’d and still
The wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses
The married couple sleep calmly in their bed
The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep
The female that loves unrequited sleeps
Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear
I go from bedside to bedside
I am the ever-laughing — it is new moon and twilight
Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine
I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician
I am she who adorn’d herself and folded her hair expectantly
Double yourself and receive me darkness
I roll myself upon you as upon a bed
He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover
Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting
My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions
It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman’s
It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight
A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin
It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy
Steady and long he struggles
The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound
I look where the ship helplessly heads end on
I cannot aid with my wringing fingers
I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash’d to us alive
The same at last and at last when peace is declared
A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead
My mother look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger
The red squaw staid all the forenoon
O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me
Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams
The homeward bound and the outward bound
I swear they are all beautiful
Peace is always beautiful
The myth of heaven indicates the soul
The soul is always beautiful
I too pass from the night
I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes
The dull nights go over and the dull days also
The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight
To think how eager we are in building our houses
I see one building the house that serves him a few years
Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river
Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell
He was a good fellow, free-mouth’d, quick-temper’d, not bad-looking
Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap
The vulgar and the refined
To think how much pleasure there is
Your farm, profits, crops — to think how engross’d you are
The domestic joys, the dally housework or business
You are not thrown to the winds
The threads that were spun are gather’d, the wet crosses the warp
The preparations have every one been justified
The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed
The law of the past cannot be eluded
The great masters and kosmos are well as they go
The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing
Of and in all these things
And I have dream’d that the purpose and essence of the known life
If all came but to ashes of dung
Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die now
Pleasantly and well-suited I walk
Darest thou now O soul
No map there, nor guide
I know it not O soul
Till when the ties loosen
Then we burst forth, we float
Whispers of heavenly death murmur’d I hear
I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses
Some parturition rather
Of him I love day and night I dream’d I heard he was dead
Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also
Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me
I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you
As if a phantom caress’d me
I need no assurances
Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither
That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning
What ship puzzled at sea
A noiseless patient spider
And you O my soul where you stand
O living always
From all the rest I single out you, having a message for you
Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you ’ust feel it
The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions
Night on the prairies
Now I absorb immortality and peace
I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited
O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot
As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is playing
At the last, tenderly
Tenderly — be not impatient
As I watch’d the ploughman ploughing
Pensive and faltering
I’d sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality
The paths to the house I seek to make
Belief I sing
The conceits of the poets of other lands I’d bring thee not
And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother
And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain
Thee in thy future
Lo, where arise three peerless stars
Land of unprecedented faith, God’s faith
Not for success alone
The soul, its destinies, the real real
Two boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still
Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive
Thou that with fructifying heat and light
Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these
Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry
This now is too lamentable a face for a man
This face is a dog’s snout sniffing for garbage
This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea
This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label
This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry
This face is bitten by vermin and worms
This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee
I see your rounded never-erased flow
Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats
Out of this face emerge banners and horses — O superb! I see what is coming
This face is a life-boat
These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake
Off the word I have spoken I except not one — red, white, black
Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me
This is a full-grown lily’s face
Lull’d and late is the smoke of the First-day morning
I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree
She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse
Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen
The melodious character of the earth
I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I catch thy notes
What charm thy music works! thou makest pass before me
Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls
O glad, exulting
Thee for my recitative
I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city
Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly
O me, man of slack faith so long
This is curious and may not be realized immediately
Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself
That which eludes this verse and any verse
Indifferently, ’mid public, private haunts, in solitude
In looks of fair unconscious babes
Two little breaths of words comprising it
Haply God’s riddle it, so vague and yet so certain
Who has gone farthest? for I would go farther
Ah poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats
Of public opinion
They shall arise in the States
Weave in, weave in, my hardy life
Out of the murk of heaviest clouds
By broad Potomac’s shore, again old tongue
From far Dakota’s canyons
The battle-bulletin
Continues yet the old, old legend of our race
As sitting in dark days
Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle
In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish
Of scenes of Nature, fields and mountains
Long have they pass’d, faces and trenches and fields
What best I see in thee
Spirit that form’d this scene
As I walk these broad majestic days of peace
I see the ships, they will last a few years
But I too announce solid things
This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless
As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud
I shall go forth
O book
Ashes of soldiers South or North
Noiseless as mists and vapors
Now sound no note O trumpeters
Nor you drummers, neither at reveille at dawn
But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade
Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet
Phantoms of countless lost
Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone
Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love
Perfume all — make all wholesome
Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain
How the great cities appear — how the Democratic masses, turbulent
Splendor of ended day floating and filling me
Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness
Good in all
I too carol the sun, usher’d or at noon, or as now, setting
As I steam’d down the Mississippi
I sing to the last the equalities modern or old
O setting sun! though the time has come
As at thy portals also death
The business man the acquirer vast
But I, my life surveying, closing
Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All
Nor alone those camps of white, old comrades of the wars
Lo, the camps of the tents of green
Now in those camps of green, in their tents dotting the world
For presently O soldiers
The sobbing of the bells, the sudden death-news everywhere
As they draw to a close
Joy, shipmate
The untold want by life and land ne’er granted
These carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see
Now finale to the shore
To conclude
I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all
When the world does what was promis’d
I have press’d through in my own right
I have offer’d my style to every one
I announce natural persons to arise
I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only
I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, unloosen’d
I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the one
I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold
I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-blooded
Hasten throat and sound your last
Screaming electric, the atmosphere using
What is there more
Camerado, this is no book
O how your fingers drowse me
Enough O deed impromptu and secret
Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss
My city’s fit and noble name resumed
I stand as on some mighty eagle’s beak
To those who’ve fail’d, in aspiration vast
A carol closing sixty-nine — a resume — a repetition
Brave
This latent mine — these unlaunch’d voices — passionate powers
As I sit writing here, sick and grown old
Did we count great, O soul, to penetrate the themes of mighty books
Approaching, nearing, curious
Greater than memory of Achilles or Ulysses
Simple and fresh and fair from winter’s close emerging
Centre of equal daughters, equal sons
After the dazzle of day is gone
To-day, from each and all, a breath of prayer — a pulse of thought
Apple orchards
Not from successful love alone
Steaming the northern rapids — an old St. Lawrence reminiscence
Had I the choice to tally greatest bards
Last of ebb, and daylight waning
And yet not you alone, twilight and burying ebb
Proudly the flood comes in, shouting, foaming, advancing
By that long scan of waves, myself call’d back, resumed upon myself
Then last of all, caught from these shores, this hill
If I should need to name, O Western World, your powerfulest scene and show
With husky-haughty lips
As one by one withdraw the lofty actors
Upon this scene, this show
Ah, not this marble
Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank
What hurrying human tides
To get the final lilt of songs
Far back, related on my mother’s side
As down the stage again
Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost
A song, a poem of itself — the word itself a dirge
Ever the undiscouraged, resolute
My science-friend, my noblest woman-friend
Small the theme of my Chant, yet the greatest — namely
Old farmers, travelers, workmen no matter how crippled or bent
Here first the duties of to-day, the lessons of the concrete
That coursing on, whate’er men’s speculations
Thanks in old age — thanks ere I go
The two old, simple problems ever intertwined
And who art thou? said I to the soft-falling shower
Thine eyes
While not the past forgetting
Amid these days of order, ease, prosperity
Have you learn’d lessons only of those who admired you
Shot gold, maroon and violet, dazzling silver, emerald, fawn
Down on the ancient wharf, the sand, I sit
A lesser proof than old Voltaire’s, yet greater
The soft voluptuous opiate shades
You lingering sparse leaves of me on winter-nearing boughs
Not meagre, latent boughs alone, O songs! scaly and bare
To-day, with bending head and eyes, thou, too, Columbia
As the Greek’s signal flame, by antique records told
In some unused lagoon, some nameless bay
Now precedent songs, farewell — by every name farewell
After a week of physical anguish
The touch of flame — the illuminating fire — the loftiest look at last
After the supper and talk — after the day is done
Sail out for Good
We know not whence, was the answer
Good-bye my fancy — I had a word to say
On, on the same
After surmounting three-score and ten
Somehow I cannot let it go yet, funeral though it is
The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion
From east and west across the horizon’s edge
Down, down
I doubt it not — then more
After a long, long course, hundreds of years, denials
Add to your show, before you close it, France
Over and through the burial chant
Ah, whispering, something again, unseen
An ancient song, reciting, ending
Of many debts incalculable
Ever so far back, preluding thee, the world
Welcome
Sounds of the winter too
As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame
When the full-grown poet came
When his hour for death had come
A voice from Death, solemn and strange, in all his sweep and power
Although I come and unannounc’d, in horror and in pang
Yea, Death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee
Then after burying, mourning the dead
War, death, cataclysm like this, the world
E’en as I chant, lo! out of death, and out of ooze and slime
For I too have forgotten
For his o’erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi
“Finally my children, to envelop each word, each part of the rest
“It is the central urge in every atom
The devilish and the dark, the dying and diseas’d
More experiences and sights, stranger
Not to exclude or demarcate
Begun in ripen’d youth and steadily pursued
I sing of life
Grand is the seen, the light, to me — grand are the sky and stars
Unseen buds, infinite, hidden well
Long have we lived, joy’d
Yet let me not be too hasty
